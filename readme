run install.sh as root

Use the Ubuntu Printers dialog, choose "Add Printer" then wait for it to populate the list, then choose the printer from "Discovered network printers". Then on the next page it should recommend the correct driver.

Original instructions: add the printer with the ppd at https://localhost:631

# Arch

Since this printer works with the drivers for Fuji Xerox DocuPrint C525 A you can use the Arch package for that as a starting point, see this thread:

https://forum.manjaro.org/t/having-trouble-installing-xerox-c525a/29042

However if you use the install process above it should work as long as you enable (Multilib)[https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/official_repositories#Enabling_multilib] and install lib32-libcups.
